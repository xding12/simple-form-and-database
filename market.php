		<h2>Trump Issues First Veto on Bill to Block His Border Emergency</h2>
		<p>
			President Trump issued his first veto, rejecting Congress's effort to cancel his declaration of a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border. The measure, which cleared the Senate with support from a dozen Republicans, had dealt him a political setback, showing cracks in GOP unity. But the Senate vote yesterday and the House vote last month were well short of the support needed to override his veto. <a target="_blank" href="https://news.yahoo.com/trump-issues-first-veto-bill-195026171.html">Click to read whole article.</a>

		<h2>Battle Lines Drawn as Parliament Votes on Delay: Brexit Update</h2>
		<p>Brexit will probably be postponed. Lawmakers vote today on delaying the March 29 deadline after rejecting a no-deal scenario last night. European Council President Donald Tusk said he will push for a long extension. Theresa May is still fighting for her deal and will likely make a third attempt to get it through next week. For now, the country remains in limbo and the political system in gridlock. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-14/deadlocked-u-k-parliament-to-vote-next-on-delay-brexit-update">Click to read whole article.</a>
